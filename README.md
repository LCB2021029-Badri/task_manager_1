# Task Manager App

## Introduction

The Task Manager App is a simple and intuitive Android application developed using Kotlin and XML, designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. Users can create, update, and delete tasks, assign priorities, set due dates, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, the app offers date preservation, ensuring that users can track tasks according to their selected dates. The app is built with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and utilizes Room for local storage, making it easy to manage tasks and ensure smooth performance.
